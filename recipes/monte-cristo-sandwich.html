    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Look forward to lunch with this sandwich inspired by the croque monsieur. Turkey, ham and Emmental are generously layered between slices of eggy bread</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>2 tsp Dijon mustard</li>
        <li>2 tsp mayonnaise</li>
        <li>2 slices white bread</li>
        <li>2 slices ham, sliced</li>
        <li>2 slices turkey, sliced</li>
        <li>50g Emmental cheese, grated</li>
        <li>1 egg</li>
        <li>2 tbsp milk</li>
        <li>knob of butter, for frying</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Method</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Mix the mustard and mayo in a small bowl, then spread over each slice of bread. Top one slice with the ham, turkey and cheese, then sandwich with the remaining slice of bread.</li>
        <li>Whisk the egg and milk in a wide, shallow bowl or dish. Soak the sandwich in the egg mixture, leaving for a few minutes on each side until all the egg has been absorbed by the bread.</li>
        <li>Melt the butter in a frying pan. When it's sizzling, add the sandwich and cook for 4-5 mins on each side until golden brown. If you have a sandwich or burger press, use this to weigh the sandwich down. If not, place a heavy lid on top to compress the sandwich and help melt the cheese. Cut in half to serve.</li>
    </ol>
